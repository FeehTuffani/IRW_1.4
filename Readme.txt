====================================================

 IRW (Injection ReWritten) was a concept tool for rewriting Injection with a much cleaner code and plugin interface.

 It was the very first project to be able to connect to OSI since UO's encryption had been entirely reverse engineered in a close project (UOEncryption).

 Later developments intended to include a scripting engine based on LUA but development was halted since I had to switch focus to other ongoing projects.

 This tool along with UOCH (C version) and UOEncryption can be found in the original repository at http://necrotoolz.sourceforge.net
